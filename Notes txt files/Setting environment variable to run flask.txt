If you are on Windows, the environment variable syntax depends on command line interpreter. On Command Prompt:

C:\path\to\app>set FLASK_APP=hello.py




And on PowerShell:

PS C:\path\to\app> $env:FLASK_APP = "hello.py"


Alternatively you can use python -m flask:

$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
$ python -m flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
This launches a very simple builtin server, which is good enough for testing but probably not what you want to use in production. For deployment options see Deployment Options.

Now head over to http://127.0.0.1:5000/, and you should see your hello world greeting.
