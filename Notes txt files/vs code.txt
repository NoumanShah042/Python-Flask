Visual Studio Code and Jinja templates

I also had a similar problem and this is what I did to fix it :

Install the Better Jinja plugin. (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samuelcolvin.jinjahtml)

This will allow you to change the file association from plain "HTML" to "jinja-html" (it's on the lower right part of my vscode screen), and this will stop jinja codes from sticking to one another on save.
At this stage your intellisense will not work anymore, causing a lot of annoyance, so :
Go to preferences >> settings >> type "file associations" in the search settings bar, click on "edit settings.json"

Finally add the following line to the settings.json file :

"emmet.includeLanguages": {"jinja-html": "html"},
Restart your vscode. Every time you open an html file with jinja templating codes, as long as jinja-html is selected (not HTML!), prettify won't mess it up, and your intellisense should be working just fine. :)
