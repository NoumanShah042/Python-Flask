Flask imports
We need to import a few things from Flask for this example:

from flask import render_template, request, session, redirect, url_for


render_template - Allows us to render a template to the browser
request - To handle the incoming form data and URL
session - The session object
redirect - Allows us to redirect users to various parts of our app
url_for - Constructs URL's from arguments



print(request.path)      # /sign-in
print(request.url)      # http://127.0.0.1:5000/sign-in
