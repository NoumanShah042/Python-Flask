****************************************


Jinja2 has no support for comments within a {{ ... }} statement. 
You can only use comments outside of such statements, and then only with {# .. #} or ## comment.


* 	 {# .. #} is only meant for disabling part of a template or adding comments outside of other Jinja2 syntax. You can't nest these.

* 	# statement is the equivalent of {% statement %}, if line statements are enabled and so configured.

* 	## comment only works if line statements are enabled, at which point it regarded as a comment.

Generally, outside of Jinja statements, use comments in the target language instead; e.g. <!-- comment --> when generating XML, etc.
