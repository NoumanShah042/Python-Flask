#  pagination
#  we can paginate the records of the model fetched from the query


>  posts = Post.query.paginate() 

> dir(posts)

> post.total    # give total posts saved in the db model


> post.per_page

give the default per page records value

> posts.page 
 give the page we are currently on 

> for post in posts.items: 	 # print 20 posts and remaining 5 are on 2nd page
	print(post)

> posts = Post.query.paginate(page=2)   #  get second page records

> for post in posts.items: 	#  print last 5 items
	print(post)


*************************************************

--> as 20 is larger value for each page we can get fewer per page 

> posts = Post.query.paginate(per_page=5)      #  by default ( page = 1 )  so do not need to pass
> posts.page
> for post in posts.items: 	#  print first 5 items
	print(post) 


> posts = Post.query.paginate(per_page=5 , page = 2 )  # get 2nd page items , with 5 items per page 
> posts.page
> for post in posts.items: 	#  print next  5 items
	print(post)  



************************


> posts = Post.query.paginate(per_page=2 )  # get 1st page items , with 2 items per page 
> posts.page
> for post in posts.items: 	#  print 2 items

> posts = Post.query.paginate(page = 6 , per_page=2  )  # get 6th page items , with 2 items per page
